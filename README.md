# c-rieger.de - install Nextcloud using a shell script
The initial script (install-nextcloud.sh) will install your self hosted Nextcloud within few minutes fully automated. Your server will be built of:

    Fail2Ban (Nextcloud and SSH jails)
    MariaDB 10.3.8
    Nextcloud 13.0.5
    NGINX 1.15.2
    OpenSSL 1.1.0h
    PHP 7.2.8
    Redis-Server
    self signed or Let's Encrypt SSL using the second script
    UFW (22, 80, 443)

The only precondition for the install-nextcloud.sh script is to utilize Ubuntu 18.04 LTS as your on-prem server OS. Optionally request your ssl certificate from Let's Encrypt by issuing the second script called "ssl-certificate.sh".
