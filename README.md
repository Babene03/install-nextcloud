# install-nextcloud
Install, optimize and harden your self hosted Nextcloud (based on Ubuntu 16.04.x LTS 64Bit) using two shell scripts only.

The initial script (install-nextcloud.sh) will install your self hosted Nextcloud within few minutes fully automated. Your server will be built of:

    MariaDB
    Nextcloud 13.0.1
    NGINX 1.14
    OpenSSL 1.1.0 h
    PHP 7.2.4
    Redis-Server
    self signed certificates or Let's Encrypt SSL

The only precondition for this script is to use Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS 64Bit as your server OS.

Configure your Nextcloud in your preferred browser and participate of the opportunity to issue the second script called "optimizations.sh", which will optimize your Nextcloud (cache, previews, cron etc.) and  install + configure fail2ban and ufw to harden your Nextcloud server. At least you may request a ssl certificate from letsencrypt by issuing the third script called "ssl-certificat.sh".
